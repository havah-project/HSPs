# HSPs

HAVAH Standards Proposals (HSPs) describe standards for the HAVAH platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.

# Contributing

The public proposal process is being prepared.

# HSP Types

* A **Standard Track HSP** describes application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards(HSP20, HSP721).
* An **Informational HSP** describes a HAVAH design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the HAVAH community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational HSPs do not necessarily represent HAVAH community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational HSPs or follow their advice.
