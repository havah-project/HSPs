| 1363 | HAVAH Payable Token Standard | KyoungNam Kim |                | Final  | Standards Track  | Contract  |         |

# Simple Summary
Defines a token interface for [HSP-20](https://github.com/havah-project/HSPs/blob/main/HSPs/HSP-20.md) tokens that supports executing recipient code after `transfer` or `transferFrom`, or spender code after `approve`.

# Abstract
Standard functions a token contract and contracts working with tokens can implement to make a token Payable.

`transferAndCall` and `transferFromAndCall` will call an `onTransferReceived` on a `HSP1363Receiver` contract.

`approveAndCall` will call an `onApprovalReceived` on a `ERC1363Spender` contract.

# Motivation
There is no way to execute code after an [HSP-20](https://github.com/havah-project/HSPs/blob/main/HSPs/HSP-20.md) transfer or approval (i.e. making a payment), so to make an action it is required to send another transaction and pay transaction fee twice.

This proposal wants to make token payments easier and working without the use of any other listener. It allows to make a callback after a transfer or approval in a single transaction.

There are many proposed uses of HAVAH smart contracts that can accept [HSP-20](https://github.com/havah-project/HSPs/blob/main/HSPs/HSP-20.md) payments.

Examples could be
- to create a token payable crowdsale
- selling services for tokens
- paying invoices
- making subscriptions

For these reasons it was named as **"Payable Token"**.

Anyway you can use it for specific utilities or for any other purposes who require the execution of a callback after a transfer or approval received.

This proposal has been inspired by the HSP-721 `onHSP721Received` and `HSP721TokenReceiver` behaviours.

# Specification
Implementing contracts **MUST** implement the HSP-1363 interface as well as the [HSP-20](https://github.com/havah-project/HSPs/blob/main/HSPs/HSP-20.md) interfaces.


```java
public interface HSP1363/* extends HSP20*/ {
    /**
     * @notice Transfer tokens from `msg.sender` to another address and then call `onTransferReceived` on receiver
     * @param _to address The address which you want to transfer to
     * @param _value BigInteger The amount of tokens to be transferred
     * @param _data bytes Additional data with no specified format, sent in call to `to`
     * @return true unless throwing
     */
    boolean transferAndCall(Address _to, BigInteger _value, @Optional byte[] _data);

    /**
     * @notice Transfer tokens from one address to another and then call `onTransferReceived` on receiver
     * @param _from address The address which you want to send tokens from
     * @param _to address The address which you want to transfer to
     * @param _value BigInteger The amount of tokens to be transferred
     * @param _data bytes Additional data with no specified format, sent in call to `to`
     * @return true unless throwing
     */
    boolean transferFromAndCall(Address _from, Address _to, BigInteger _value, @Optional byte[] _data);

    /**
     * @notice Approve the passed address to spend the specified amount of tokens on behalf of caller
     * and then call `onApprovalReceived` on spender.
     * @param _spender address The address which will spend the funds
     * @param _value BigInteger The amount of tokens to be spent
     * @param _data bytes Additional data with no specified format, sent in call to `spender`
     * @return true unless throwing
     */
    boolean approveAndCall(Address _spender, BigInteger _value, @Optional byte[] _data);
}
```

A contract that wants to accept token payments via `transferAndCall` or `transferFromAndCall` **MUST** implement the following interface:


```java
/**
* @title HSP1363Receiver interface
* @dev Interface for any contract that wants to support `transferAndCall` or `transferFromAndCall`
*  from HSP1363 token contracts.
   */
   public interface HSP1363Receiver {
   /**
    * @notice Handle the receipt of HSP1363 tokens
    * @dev Any HSP1363 smart contract calls this function on the recipient
    * after a `transfer` or a `transferFrom`. This function MAY throw to revert and reject the
    * transfer. Return of other than true MUST result in the
    * transaction being reverted.
    * Note: the token contract address is always the message sender.
    * @param _operator address The address which called `transferAndCall` or `transferFromAndCall` function
    * @param _from address The address which are token transferred from
    * @param _value BigInteger The amount of tokens transferred
    * @param _data bytes Additional data with no specified format
    * @return true unless throwing
    */
   boolean onTransferReceived(Address _operator, Address _from, BigInteger _value, byte[] _data);
   }
```
      
A contract that wants to accept token payments via `approveAndCall` **MUST** implement the following interface:

```java
/**
* @title HSP1363Spender interface
* @dev Interface for any contract that wants to support `approveAndCall`
*  from HSP1363 token contracts.
   */
   public interface HSP1363Spender {
   /**
    * @notice Handle the approval of HSP1363 tokens
    * @dev Any HSP1363 smart contract calls this function on the recipient
    * after an `approve`. This function MAY throw to revert and reject the
    * approval. Return of other than true MUST result in the
    * transaction being reverted.
    * Note: the token contract address is always the message sender.
    * @param _owner address The address which called `approveAndCall` function
    * @param _value BigInteger The amount of tokens to be spent
    * @param _data bytes Additional data with no specified format
    * @return true unless throwing
    */
   boolean onApprovalReceived(Address _owner, BigInteger _value, byte[] _data);
   }
```      

# Rationale
The choice to use `transferAndCall`, `transferFromAndCall` and `approveAndCall` derives from the [HSP-20](https://github.com/havah-project/HSPs/blob/main/HSPs/HSP-20.md) naming. They want to highlight that they have the same behaviours of `transfer`, `transferFrom` and `approve` with the addition of a callback on receiver or spender.

# Backwards Compatibility
This proposal has been inspired by [HSP-721](https://github.com/havah-project/HSPs/blob/main/HSPs/HSP-721.md) approach, so it doesn't override the [HSP-20](https://github.com/havah-project/HSPs/blob/main/HSPs/HSP-20.md) `transfer` and `transferFrom` methods to be implemented maintaining the [HSP-20](https://github.com/havah-project/HSPs/blob/main/HSPs/HSP-20.md) backwards compatibility.

# Security Considerations
The `approveAndCall` and `transferFromAndCall` methods can be affected by the same issue of the standard [HSP-20](https://github.com/havah-project/HSPs/blob/main/HSPs/HSP-20.md) `approve` and `transferFrom` method.

Changing an allowance with the `approveAndCall` methods brings the risk that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate transaction ordering.

One possible solution to mitigate this race condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards.
